    <h1>Sitcom Tribute Page</h1>

    <p> A sitcom, clipping for situational comedy (situation comedy in the U.S.), is a genre of comedy centered on a
        fixed set of characters who
        carry over from episode to episode. Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new
        characters in each sketch,
        and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but
        today are found mostly on
        television as one of its dominant narrative forms.</p>
    <p>A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the
        programme's production format.
        The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track. During filming
        productions,
        the laugh track is usually pre-recorded.</p>
    <p>Critics disagree over the utility of the term "sitcom" in classifying shows that have come into existence since
        the turn of the century.
        Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track, thus often
        resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s
        rather than the traditional sitcom.</p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>Jeff Winger is disbarred and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a
        bachelor's degree from
        Columbia University. To earn a legitimate degree, he enrolls at Greendale Community College in Colorado.
        He quickly becomes attracted to his classmate, social activist Britta Perry, and pretends to run a study group
        in order to spend time with her.
        However, Britta invites classmate Abed Nadir (who struggles with social interactions and is obsessed with pop
        culture),
        who in turn brings other classmates along: highly religious single mother Shirley Bennett, naïve over-achiever
        Annie Edison,
        former high school football star Troy Barnes, and cynical elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their
        differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.
        They are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school
        seem more respectable,
        as well as having to deal with the antics of their mentally unstable teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.

        manager;
